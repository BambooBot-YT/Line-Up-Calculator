# Installation (For Contributors)

If you are considering contributing to this project. We and the Open-source community thank you for this 🙏.

Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated. There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation,
submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the calculator itself.

> [!NOTE]
> Before implementing a new feature or a bug fix, please open an [issue](https://github.com/BambooBot-YT/Line-Up-Calculator/issues) first. This will allow us to discuss the specficiation, and the best way to implement it.

## Get started

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account and then
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.

2. Start Unity Hub and open the folder you just cloned using it.
> [!NOTE]
> If you do not have syntax highlighting or intellisense in Visual Studio 2022, make sure you have the [Unity extention for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/gamedev/unity/get-started/getting-started-with-visual-studio-tools-for-unity?pivots=windows) installed.

3. Make any changes to the code. Once you have made a change, commit the feature to your local repository.
    ```sh
    git commit -am "Added new molly type"
    ```

4. Once you are happy with your changes, push to a new branch on your forked repository (e.g. `featurename-username` with `featurename` and `username` replaced).
    ```sh
    git branch -m featurename-username
    git push origin featurename-username    
    ```
> [!WARNING]
> Never directly attempt to merge into `stable` it will be denied only core team members are allowed to update `stable`

5. After pushing your changes to a new branch on your forked repository (e.g., `featurename-username`), you need to create a pull request to merge your changes back into the `dev` branch of the main repository. A pull request allows others to review your code and discuss any necessary changes before merging it into the main codebase.

To create a pull request:
  - Go to the GitHub page of your forked repository.
  - Switch to the branch containing your changes.
  - Click on the "Pull Request" button or navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab and click "New Pull Request."
  - Choose the base branch (usually `dev`) and the branch containing your changes.
  - Provide a clear title and description for your pull request, explaining the purpose of your changes.
  - Review the changes and ensure all necessary files are included.
  - Submit the pull request and wait for feedback from a core team member.
